# StepBack: An NBA Social Media App

## Introduction
This is the backend for Stepback, a WIP NBA social media app. To see the frontend code, see [this repo](https://github.com/ajuneja23/stepback-frontend "Frontend").


## Project Description
Currently, the frontend allows the user to sign up or login. Passwords are encrypted and JSON web tokens are issued for authorization. Then, users can view all the posts or create their own new post. Backend development has other features implemented, such as deleting your account or filtering the posts you want to see, but this has not been implemented on the frontend yet. The backend was created with Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, the nba npm package, express, and various other tools.
